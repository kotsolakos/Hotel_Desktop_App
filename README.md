# Hotel_Desktop_App
A simple Java project that creates a desktop app which connects to a PostgreSQL database which holds hotel room data such as an image and a text description, as well as user data.
The app has multiple tabs, which show all the rooms and also filter among available and reserved rooms.
The app also allows for the data of the rooms to be updated in the database.
